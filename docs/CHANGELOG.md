  - Comprehensive workflow validation
  - Coverage reporting and requirements
- **Asynchronous PDF Search**: PDF viewer opens instantly with background search
- **UI Improvements**: Centralized styling and responsive design

### Fixed
- **Test Suite Reliability**: All 24 tests now pass consistently
- **Integration Test Issues**: Fixed KeyError and AttributeError in application flow tests
- **Build Artifacts**: Cleaned up and properly ignored build artifacts
- **Path References**: Updated all tool references to use `scripts/` directory
- **GitHub Actions**: Fixed deprecated actions and workflow paths

### Added
- **Robust Logging System**: Implemented a centralized, file-based logging system that saves daily logs to a `logs/` directory.
- **Root Entry Point**: Created a `run.py` file in the root directory to provide a clean, standard entry point for the application.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added checks to gracefully handle missing database and configuration files, showing user-friendly error messages.
- **PDF Search Navigation**: Added "Next" and "Previous" buttons to the PDF viewer to easily navigate between search results, along with a `(current/total)` counter.

### Changed
- **Asynchronous PDF Search**: The PDF viewer now opens instantly and performs searches in the background, dramatically improving UI responsiveness.
- **Project Structure**: Refined the project structure by adding `run.py` and a `logging_config.py` module, and ensuring `src` is a proper package.
- **Code Quality & Refactoring**:
    - Centralized all UI styles into a single method for easier theme management.
    - Secured the PDF processing script against potential SQL injection by validating table names.
    - Standardized all Python scripts to follow PEP 8 conventions, such as placing all imports at the top of the file.

### Fixed
- **PDF Viewer Zoom Jump**: Fixed a critical bug where zooming would cause the view to jump to an incorrect page. The viewer now maintains its position during zoom operations.
- **PDF Viewer Zoom Out**: Corrected an issue that prevented zooming out to less than 100%.
- **PDF Viewer Spurious Scrolling**: Fixed a bug where clicking the zoom buttons would also incorrectly scroll the document.
